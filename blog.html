      <h1>Reducing Patient Wait Times</h1>
      <p>Patient waiting time refers to a patient wait in the hospital before receiving medical services. Its length largely determines a patient’s satisfaction or dissatisfaction with the healthcare provider.
        <br>Modern software helps with reducing patient wait times.<br>A doctor appointment mobile app enables patients to monitor the schedule of the doctor they need to see. They can find a slot most suitable for them and check themselves in immediately.</p>

      <h1>Simplifying the Process of Finding a Doctor</h1>
      <p>A hospital’s appointment booking website usually has a listing of doctors. When a patient needs an appointment urgently but sees that their doctor is fully booked, <br>they may look at the schedules of other available doctors at a specific hospital instead of turning to the competitor. </p> </div>
      <div class="width60">
      <h1>Increasing Patient Satisfaction</h1>
      <p>patients feel like the healthcare provider really does its best to meet their needs, makes care more accessible, that they are actually listened to and taken care of. <br>Consequently, appointment booking mobile apps help hospitals to attract customers and retain them through higher satisfaction levels.</p></div>
